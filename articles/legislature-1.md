# Article 1 - The Legislature

## Section 1

All of the legislative powers granted by this Constitution will be vested in a Congress of the United States, which will consist of a Senate, a House of Representatives, and an Assembly of Citizens.

The House of Representatives and Senate shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meetings shall begin at noon on the third day of January, unless Congress, by law, appoint a different day.

## Section 2 -- the House of Representatives

The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every third year by the total population of the United States of America.

No person shall be a representative who has not met the following conditions:

* They shall have attained the age of 25
* They have been a citizen of the United States for at least seven years.
* They make their primary residence in the state they represent.

To determine the population of the states and the total population of the nation, a census should be conducted every ten years, using the most accurate methods of calculating the population, whether that is a direct count, sampling, or other method.  

The House of Representatives will have at least one member for each 750,000 citizens in the United States, made of "State Representatives" and "National Representatives"

Each state and the District of Columbia is entitled to at least one state representative plus one state representative for each one million citizens (rounded down) it contains. Each state legislature may create either:

* one district for each representative, elected via instant runoff voting.  Districts shall contain the same population in each district.

or

* multi-member districts to elect between three and seven representatives at one time, using the single transferable vote method. Districts should contain the same ratio of population to representatives.

These districts shall be determined by the state legislatures in accordance with federal law. If a state fails to pass a district map acceptable to the federal district court, in a reasonable time frame before an election, the federal district court is empowered to appoint a non-partisan, disinterested commission to create a map for the state.  

The remainder of the seats shall be apportioned proportionally by a national vote of all U.S. citizens for the political party they wish to lead the legislature.

A political party must meet the following qualifications to be listed on the ballot for the party vote:

* The party must create a ranked list of candidates and hold a fundamentally democratic primary process to determine the rank of each candidate. Each citizen can only vote in one political party's primary.

* The party must have received at least 50,000 voters in their party primary.

For each party that either gains at least 4% of the popular vote or has at least one other state representative, national representatives will be elected from the party lists in the order they are listed (save any candidates already elected as a state representative,) so that the total number of representatives, including both state and national representatives, is proportionate to the proportion of votes each party received in the party vote.

When vacancies happen in the Representation from any State, the Executive authority of each state shall issue a writ of election to fill the vacancy.

The House of Representatives shall choose their Speaker and other officers,

The House of Representatives shall have the sole power of Impeachment.

## Section 3 - The Senate
The Senate of the United States shall be composed of three Senators from each
State, elected by the people of each state, for six Years; and each Senator shall
have one Vote.

Elections for the senate shall be held every three years, with half the states holding their election at any time, alternating by date in which they joined the Union. (So that the second, fourth, sixth, etc. states to join the union have their elections three years after the senatorial elections for the first, third, fifth, etc. states.)

When vacancies happen in the representation of any state in the Senate, the executive authority of such state shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies, provided that the legislature of any State may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct.

No person shall be a senator who has not met the following conditions:

* They shall have attained the age of 30
* They have been a citizen of the United States for at least nine years.
* They make their primary residence in the state they represent, and have done so for a period no shorter than three years prior.

The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but
shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided.

The Senate shall choose their other Officers, and also a President pro tempore,
in the absence of the Vice President, or when he shall exercise the Office of
President of the United States.

The Senate shall have the sole power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for
that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the
United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be
convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.

Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from
Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or
Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be
liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to
Law.

## Section 4 - Assembly of Citizens.

All citizens who have attained the age of eighteen are eligible to join the Assembly of Citizens.

Upon the joint request of at least one senator and one representative, legislation that has passed the House and Senate to be signed into law can be
brought before the Assembly of Citizens.

One thousand citizens from the Assembly will then be chosen at random to form a jury to review the bill. This jury will be contacted via both electronic mail, postal mail, and telephone, and be given seven days to register their reply. A website will be provided which allows members of the jury to register their assent or dissent, though they may also reply via postal mail, for which postage will have been paid. Responses not received within the time frame are considered to be assenting votes. If three-fifths of the jury vote to dissent, the bill is not passed into law, and sent back to the House to which the bill originates.

## Section 5 - Elections, Meetings.

The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and
Representatives, shall be as followed:

* Primary elections are to be held on July 4th, with early voting available for two weeks prior.

* General elections are to be held on the first Sunday following the first Monday in November, with early voting available for three weeks prior.  

The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meeting shall
be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by law appoint a
different day.

## Section 6 - Membership, Rules, Journals, Adjournment

The House of Representatives and the Senate shall be the judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own members, and a majority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business; but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members, in such manner, and under such penalties as each House may provide.

The House of Representatives also shall be the judge of results from the Assembly of Citizens.

Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its members for
disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a member.

Each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and from time to time
publish the same, excepting such parts as may in their judgment require
secrecy; and the yeas and nays of the members of either House on any question
shall, at the desire of one fifth of those present, be entered on the journal.

Neither House, during the session of Congress, shall, without the consent of
the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other place than that
in which the two Houses shall be sitting.

## Section 7 - Compensation

The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their
Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United
States.

No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened.

They shall in all cases, except treason, felony, and breach of the
peace, be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of
their respective houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for
any speech or debate in either house, they shall not be questioned in any other
place.

No Senator or Representative shall, during the time for which he or she was elected, be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the United States which shall have been created, or the compensation or perquisites shall have been increased during such time.

No person holding any office under the United States, shall be a member of either the House of Representative or the Senate during his or her continuance in office.

## Section 8 - Revenue Bills, Legislative Process, Presidential and Assembly Veto

All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.

Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a law, be presented to the President of the United States, and with the request of a member of the House and a member of the Senate, be presented to a jury from the Assembly of Citizens.

If the President approves of the bill, he or she will sign it.

If the President does not approve of the bill, he or she shall return it with his objections to the house in which it shall have originated. That house will then enter the objections at large on their journal.

If the jury of the Assembly of Citizens votes by three-fifths majority to dissent from the bill, the bill will be returned to the house in which it shall have originated. That house will then enter into their record that the bill was declined by the Assembly of Citizens.

At that point, either house, if they wish, may reconsider the bill. If after such reconsideration, two thirds of that house agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, together with any Presidential objections, to the other house, where it will likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that house, it shall become a Law.

In all such cases, the votes of both house shall be determined by Yeas and Nays, and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each house, respectively.

If any bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, as if he had signed it, become law, unless the Congress, by their adjournment, prevents its return, in which case it shall not be a law.

Every order, resolution, or vote, to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of adjournment), shall be presented to the President of the United States. Before the order, resolution, or vote take effect, the President must approve it, or, being disapproved by him, be re-passed by two-thirds of the Senate and the House of Representatives, according to the same rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill.
